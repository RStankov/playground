code
	- better options manipulation
		- cancelable option
		- bubble to in options do not throw it around as argument
	- lazy loading
	- setting relatedTarget in mouseEvent ( to check )
	- maybe come down to only 2 or 3 create event methods
	- clear code smells
	- mouseenter / mouseleave ?

tests:
	- test all options (mouse)
	- test all options (key)
	- IE
	- Opera
	- Chrome
